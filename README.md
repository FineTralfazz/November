# November
October is the scariest month of the year. However, some people don't like to be scared. Thanks to our revolutionary invention, they don't have to be.

It's the best explanation.

## How it works
We strapped a Raspberry Pi, camera, battery pack, and servo motors, and a speaker to a pair of glasses. The Raspberry Pi takes images every second, and sends them to Amazon Rekognition for object detection. If it detects anything spooky, it uses the servos to cover the wearer's eyes and plays an alert.

## Why?
November was developed by [Brandon Abbott](https://github.com/PerfectEcho), Josi Zugg, and [Chris Bailey](https://github.com/FineTralfazz) for the 2019 [AK Dev Alliance](https://akdevalliance.com/) Hackathon. We didn't feel like working on a "useful" project, because that felt too much like real work, so we came up with this.
